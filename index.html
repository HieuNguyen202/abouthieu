    I was born in a small village in the Southern Vietnam. My family were
    traditionally farmers, so I spent most of childhood in the fields of rice
    whose borders are at the end of the horizon. Since very early ages, I was
    taught that education was one of the best ways keep me away from poverty and
    make me a fine, interesting person. Therefore, unlike most of young boys in
    my village, who settled for a family at their 20's, I went to Sai Gon, one
    of Vietnamâ€™s biggest cites, to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Business
    Management. As I was in my third year in college, there was a family event
    that required me to relocate to the United States. Coming to the U.S. was an
    exciting opportunity but also was challenging, but I would like to save this
    thought for a book that I hope to write when I get older.

    In my book, I will probably reserve a chapter for my days in the Illinois
    Institute Technology, where I obtain Electical Engineering education. One of
    the things at IIT that have inspired me into the engineering discipline is
    the RMC team. RMC team is a group of talented students who come from many
    different disciplines. We gather weekly to design and build a prototype for
    a Martian robot, which will become one of the participating robots of the <a
    href="https://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/centers/kennedy/technology/nasarmc.html">2018
    NASA Robotic Mining Competition</a> (NASA RMC). As a proud member of 2017
    RMC team, I developed the robot's control software in which the robot can be
    remotely controlled as if it was in a Mars exploration mission. One thing
    that makes RMC most memorable to me is that after intense arguments and
    sleepless nights working on the robot, we managed to have a decent little
    robot, running back and forth in NASA's facility; and most of all I met very
    good friends who shared the same passion: building a robot that conquers
    2018 NASA RMC.

    The second thing that inspires me to pursue the Engineering profession is
    the co-op at the Ford Motor Company. At Ford, I work closely with the
    factory's senior control engineers, who were nice enough to spend a good
    amount of time to answer my questions about the factory's automation system.
    Some of the projects I have done so far are: installing a safety sensor to
    position the cars into their carriers, drawing layouts of the the door
    conveyor system. At the end of this co-op, I hope to obtain an overall
    picture of a control engineer's job as well as industrial
    automation.

    As for Standard Web Design (COM 330), creating websites has always been
    something I would like to know. In the past, I used to build some web pages
    using a online tools such as WordPress. Although I was able to create a
    website that is accessible via the Internet, I was not able to make any
    modifications to my site because I did not know how to so. As a main purpose
    of taking this class, I expect to be able to maintain an online present for
    my family's business, to controll the RMC robot via a web interface, or just
    simply to post personal blogs and interesting stories.
