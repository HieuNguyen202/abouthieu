      If i was to describe my self in one word, that word would be Hieu. My name is
      Hieu Nguyen. I was born in a small village in Viet Nam, where i spent most of
      childhood in the fields. When i turned 18, i packed my luggages and came to Ho
      Chi Minh city to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Business Management at the
      University of Economics. Three years later, i realized that Business Management
      wasn't for me, so i quitted and packed my luggage again for the next adventure:
      to the US. I came to the U.S. in 2013 in a quest for better education. Since
      then four years have come by, and i landed in IIT for my education in Electrical
      Engineering, a field that i never thought of when i was in the fields 20 years
      ago.

      Two of the things have inspired me into the engineering discipline are the RMC
      team and my current Co-op. The RMC team is a talented group of students who come
      from many different disciplines. We gather weekly to work on designing and
      building a prototype for a Martian robot, which will be one of the participating
      robots of the 2018 NASA Robotic Mining Competition. As a proud member of the
      2017 RMC team, i developed the robot's control system in which the robot can be
      remotely controlled as if it was on Mars. If you think building a robot for a
      NASA competition is astounding, you are absolutely right. Helping building a
      robot from scratch until it is fully completed was one of the best engineering
      experience for me.

      The second thing that inspires me as an engineer is the co-op at a well known
      car manufacturer. I dedicated this entire semester to do work as a control
      engineer, where i have been learning about industrial automations (and no, i'm
      not building cars. I'm "building" processes that helps building cars). What i
      would like to get out of this co-op is the overall picture of a control
      engineer's tasks and all the tool necessary for the job. It's only so excited
      when there is a machine breaks down because then all the engineer will perform
      their "magics" to turn the machine back to its original state; no one knows how
      they did it neither they care.

      My ambition in this class is to be able to control the Web, (yes, the entire
      Internet). Creating websites has always been something i would like to know. In
      the past, I used to build some web pages using online tools such as Word Press.
      Although i was able to create a website that is accessible via the Internet, I
      was not able to make any modifications to my site because i just don't know how
      to so. As a main purpose of taking this class, i expect to become web wizard at
      the time this class is over. It will enable me to so many things on the web such
      as maintaining a online present for my family's business, interfacing with the
      RMC robot via a web page, Or just simply posting personal blogs and interesting
      stories.
