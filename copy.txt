I was born in a small village in the Southern Vietnam. My family were
traditionally farmers, so I spent most of childhood in the rice fields whose
borders are at the end of the horizon. Since very early, I was taught education
was one of the best tools keep me away from poverty and make me a fine,
interesting person. Therefore, unlike most of the young boys in my village, who
settled for a family at their 20s, I went to Sai Gon, one of Vietnamâ€™s biggest
cites, to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in a Business major. As I was in my third
year in college, there was a family event that requires me to relocate to the
United States. Coming to the U.S. was an exciting opportunity but also
challenging, but I would like to save this thought for a book that I hope to
write when I get older.

In my book, I will probably reserve a chapter about my days in the Illinois
Institute Technology, where I come for EE education. One of the things at IIT
that have inspired me into the engineering discipline are the RMC team. RMC team
is a group of talented students who come from many different disciplines. We
gather weekly to design and build a prototype for a Martian robot, which will
become one of the participating robots of the 2018 NASA Robotic Mining
Competition (NASA RMC). As a proud member of 2017 RMC team, I developed the
robot's control software in which the robot can be remotely controlled as if it
was on Mars in an exploration mission. One things that makes RMC most memorable
to me is that after intense arguments and sleepless nights working on the robot,
we managed to have a decent little robot, running back and for in NASA facility;
and most of all, I made very good friends who shared the same passion: building
a robot that conquers 2018 NASA RMC.

The second thing that inspires to pursue the Engineering profession is the co-op
at the Ford Motor Company. At Ford, I work closely with the senior control
engineers, who are nice enough to spend a good amount of time to answer my
questions about the factory automation system. Some of the projects I have done
so far are: installing a safety sensor to position the car into the carriers,
drawing layouts of the the chain system. At the end of this co-op, I hope to
obtain an overall picture of a control engineer's job as well as industrial
automation.

As for Standard Web Design (COM 330), creating websites has always been
something I would like to know. In the past, I used to build some web pages
using a online tool such as WordPress. Although I was able to create a website
that is accessible via the Internet, I was not able to make any modifications to
my site because I did not know how to so. As a main purpose of taking this
class, I expect to be able to maintain an online present for my family's
business, interface with the RMC robot via a web interface, or just simply
posting personal blogs and interesting stories.
